            <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers are still soft.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool: </strong>Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
