This is my effort at the Recipes project as part of The Odin Project's 
Foundations curriculum. I'll be creating a basic recipe website with the knowledge
in HTML I've learned so far, demonstrating a proper use of tags, elements, and
attributes. I'll also be attempting appropriate Git commit conventions throughout
the project to become more comfortable with the system.
