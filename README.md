This is my attempt at the Recipes project as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. This is a basic recipe website created in HTML to exhibit the skills I've learned so far, with a demonstration of the proper use of tags, elements, and attributes. I'll also be practicing appropriate Git commit conventions throughout the project to become more comfortable with the system.
